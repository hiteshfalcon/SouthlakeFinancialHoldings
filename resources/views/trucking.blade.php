                <p class="py-2">Millions of trucks traverse America's roads and highways daily, transporting the products that keep the economy moving. With 72.6% of all freight by weight in the United States carried by trucks, insurers play a crucial role in an industry that employs millions of people and keeps our shops and warehouses stocked.</p>
                <p class="py-2">Our commercial large and small fleet coverage provides both large and small truck fleet owners with the peace of mind to keep freight moving quickly and on time. Our Fleet and Transportation Insurance coverage line options offer major benefits that agents trust to keep fleet owners across the country protected.</p>

                <p class="py-2">We prefer exposures with generally lower risks, such as dry van, cargo, intermodal and refrigerated trucks. We avoid riskier exposures such as cattle and livestock, garbage haulers, and sand and gravel trucks. Focusing on low-risk exposures helps keep our premiums competitive while maintaining profitability for our company and agents.</p>
                <p class="py-2">Our insurance coverage can also be tailored to fit the demands of individual fleets. We provide $1 million Combined Single Limit auto liability for fleets with the ability to write up to $2 million. Additionally, while our maximum coverage for motor truck cargo is $500,000, we can customize this figure for loads that are valued lower.</p>
                <p class="py-2">Our full line of coverage for both large and small fleets include:</p>
                <ul>
